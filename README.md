This project contains a boilerplate to start a GraphQL API using serverless and express (CORS-enabled).

It's DB engine agnostic, so it could be implemented with MongoDB, PostgreSQL or any other engine.

Tests are already configured with jest, but some additional configuration may be required if it's desired to use an in-memory DB server.
